    "Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.\n",

    "An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreter and type code right into it. If you ever have a question like, \"What happens if I add an int to a list?\" Just typing it into the Python interpreter is a fast and likely the best way to see what happens.

    "### Variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python variables don't have any type spelled out in the source code, it's extra helpful to give meaningful names to your variables to remind yourself of what's going on. So use \"name\" if it's a single name, and \"names\" if it's a list of names, and \"tuples\" if it's a list of tuples. Many basic Python errors result from forgetting what type of value is in each variable, so use your variable names (all you have really) to help keep things straight.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as actual naming goes, some languages prefer underscored_parts for variable names made up of \"more than one word,\" but other languages prefer camelCasing. In general, Python prefers the underscore method but guides developers to defer to camelCasing if integrating into existing Python code that already uses that style. Readability counts. Read more in the section on naming conventions in PEP 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can guess, keywords like 'print' and 'while' cannot be used as variable names â€” you'll get a syntax error if you do. However, be careful not to use built-ins as variable names. For example, while 'str' and 'list' may seem like good names, you'd be overriding those system variables. Built-ins are not keywords and thus, are susceptible to inadvertent use by new Python developers."

    "* `help('xyz'.split)` â€” help string for the `split()` method for string objects. You can call `help()` with that object itself or an example of that object, plus its attribute. For example, calling `help('xyz'.split)` is the same as calling `help(str.split)`.\n",

    "Python strings are \"immutable\" which means they cannot be changed after they are created (Java strings also use this immutable style). Since strings can't be changed, we construct *new* strings as we go to represent computed values. So for example the expression ('hello' + 'there') takes in the 2 strings 'hello' and 'there' and builds a new string 'hellothere'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters in a string can be accessed using the standard [ ] syntax, and like Java and C++, Python uses zero-based indexing, so if str is 'hello' str[1] is 'e'. If the index is out of bounds for the string, Python raises an error. The Python style (unlike Perl) is to halt if it can't tell what to do, rather than just make up a default value. The handy \"slice\" syntax (below) also works to extract any substring from a string. The len(string) function returns the length of a string. The [ ] syntax and the len() function actually work on any sequence type -- strings, lists, etc.. Python tries to make its operations work consistently across different types. Python newbie gotcha: don't use \"len\" as a variable name to avoid blocking out the len() function. The '+' operator can concatenate two strings. Notice in the code below that variables are not pre-declared -- just assign to them and go."

    "A tuple is a fixed size grouping of elements, such as an (x, y) co-ordinate. Tuples are like lists, except they are immutable and do not change size (tuples are not strictly immutable since one of the contained elements could be mutable). Tuples play a sort of \"struct\" role in Python -- a convenient way to pass around a little logical, fixed size bundle of values. A function that needs to return multiple values can just return a tuple of the values. For example, if I wanted to have a list of 3-d coordinates, the natural python representation would be a list of tuples, where each tuple is size 3 holding one (x, y, z) group.\n",

    "To create a tuple, just list the values within parenthesis separated by commas. The \"empty\" tuple is just an empty pair of parenthesis. Accessing the elements in a tuple is just like a list -- len(), [ ], for, in, etc. all work the same."
